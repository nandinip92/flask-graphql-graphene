# üêç What is Flask?

Flask is a **lightweight web framework in Python** that helps you build web applications and APIs. Instead of writing everything from scratch, Flask gives you the basic tools to:

- Handle **routes** (decide what happens when someone visits a URL).
- Process **requests and responses**.
- Render **HTML templates** or return data (like JSON for APIs).

It‚Äôs called a ‚Äú**microframework‚Äù** because it only includes the essentials, letting you add extra features (like databases, authentication, etc.) through extensions when you need them. This makes it very flexible ‚Äî you can use it for small projects, or scale it up to bigger ones.

```python
from flask import Flask

app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route("/")
def hello():
    return "Hello, Flask!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    app.run()
```

- When you run this code, Flask starts a small development server.
- By default, it runs on http://127.0.0.1:5000/ ‚Üí Port 5000 is Flask‚Äôs default if you don‚Äôt specify one.
- You can change the port if needed:

```python
app.run(port=8080)
```

## üîë Key points to remember

- Default host: 127.0.0.1 (localhost).
- Default port: 5000.
- Great for learning, prototyping, and even production (with a proper WSGI server like Gunicorn or uWSGI).

**üëâ In short:**
Flask = a simple, flexible way to build web apps and APIs in Python.
