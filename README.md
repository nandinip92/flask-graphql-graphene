# ðŸ§© Flask + GraphQL Demo

This is a minimal project demonstrating how Flask and GraphQL work together.
It uses Flask as the lightweight web framework and Graphene to define a simple GraphQL schema.

The demo includes:

- A basic `hello` query (`{ hello }`) that returns `"Hello, World!"`
- Integration of GraphQLView to expose a `/graphql` endpoint
- Support for the GraphiQL interface to interactively test queries in the browser
- This project serves as a quick starting point for learning how to build GraphQL APIs with Flask.
