# ðŸ§© Flask + GraphQL Demo

This is a minimal project demonstrating how Flask and GraphQL work together.
It uses Flask as the lightweight web framework and Graphene to define a simple GraphQL schema.

The demo includes:

- A basic `hello` query (`{ hello }`) that returns `"Hello, World!"`
- Integration of GraphQLView to expose a `/graphql` endpoint
- Support for the GraphiQL interface to interactively test queries in the browser
- This project serves as a quick starting point for learning how to build GraphQL APIs with Flask.

## Project setup

### 1. Create a new directory for you project and navigateinto it

```bash
mkdir graphql-flask-demo
cd graphql-flask-demo
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:

Itâ€™s best practice to use a virtual environment for each Python project. This isolates your projectâ€™s dependencies from other projects or the system Python, avoids version conflicts, and makes it easier to share your project with others.

```bash
python -m venv venv        # Create a virtual environment

# Activate it:
# Windows(command prompt):
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Windows (PowerShell)
.\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

#git bash of windows
source venv/Scripts/activate

# Linux/MacOS:
source venv/bin/activate

```

While activated, any packages you install will only affect this project.

#### Why Create a Virtual Environment?

1. Isolate Dependencies

   - Each Python project may need different libraries or different versions of the same library.
   - A virtual environment ensures that your projectâ€™s dependencies donâ€™t conflict with other projects or the system Python.

2. Avoid System Pollution

   - Installing packages globally can clutter your system Python and might require admin rights.
   - With a virtual environment, all packages are stored inside the project folder.

3. Reproducibility

   - Virtual environments make it easier to share your project with others.
   - Using `requirements.txt` with `pip install -r requirements.txt`, others can recreate the exact environment you used.

4. Safe Experimentation

   - You can try out new packages or versions without affecting other projects or your system Python.

### 3. Install Required Dependencies

With the virtual environment active, install Flask, Flask-GraphQL, and Graphene:

```bash
pip install Flask Flask-GraphQL graphene

```

### 4. Save Dependencies to requirements.txt

After installing the packages, generate a requirements.txt file so others (or yourself on another machine) can recreate the same environment:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

- This file will list all installed packages with exact versions
- Example content of `requirements.txt`:

```ini
Flask==2.3.2
Flask-GraphQL==2.0.1
graphene==3.2.1
```

- Share this file in your repository. Others can install the same packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**_Note:_**

- If someone clones your repo, they can install all required packages at once using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 5. Add `.gitignore`

Make sure to ignore your virtual environment folder in Git so it doesnâ€™t get committed to the repository.

Add this to your .gitignore file:

```bash
venv/
```

This ensures that only your code and requirements.txt are tracked, while the virtual environment (which can be recreated anytime) is excluded.

**Important:**

- Make sure you run this after creating and **activating** the virtual environment to ensure all packages are installed inside it.
- If the **virtual environment is not active**, the packages will be installed globally on your system Python, which may cause conflicts with other projects.
